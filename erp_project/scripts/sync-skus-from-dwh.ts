/**
 * Sync master_skus + details_sku from the SKU data warehouse
 * (mcaff_dwh.All_Product_Name_MRP_Mapping).
 *
 * Why: master_skus/details_sku are what every SKU dropdown, PO create/edit,
 * and BOM picker reads from -- but in dev they were empty/stale while the
 * DWH table (wired up for the /masters/skus list page) is the current,
 * live source of SKU data. Rather than rewiring every read site to a second
 * database, this pushes the DWH data into master_skus/details_sku so all
 * existing queries keep working unchanged.
 *
 * The DWH table has multiple rows per Sku_code (one per external
 * marketplace/channel mapping key, e.g. ASIN, Shopify id) plus historical
 * price rows keyed by [start_date, end_date]. For each Sku_code we take the
 * row(s) from the latest end_date window (the currently-effective price
 * period), then MAX()-collapse any remaining duplicate rows within that
 * window (their core fields -- name/brand/category/mrp/hsn/sku_type -- are
 * identical in all but a handful of known data-quality exceptions).
 *
 * Same DB user (ERP_Tech_Admin) has grants on both schemas on the same
 * host, so this runs as plain cross-schema SQL -- no need to pull rows into
 * Node and re-insert them.
 *
 * Run: npx tsx scripts/sync-skus-from-dwh.ts
